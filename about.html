From a young age, he’s been fascinated by the beauty and engineering of auto mobiles. What began as a childhood hobby of collecting miniature cars evolved into a lifelong passion for building a collection of real, iconic vehicles. For him, cars are more than just machines — they are works of art that combine power, design, and innovation. He spends countless hours researching, restoring, and showcasing his collection, seeing each vehicle as a reflection of a different era, philosophy, and piece of automotive history.
