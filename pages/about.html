            <h2>The Owner</h2>
            <p>
                From a young age, John O'Reilly has been fascinated by the beauty and engineering of automobiles. What began as a childhood hobby of collecting miniature cars evolved into a lifelong passion for building a collection of real, iconic vehicles. For John, cars are more than just machines â€” they are works of art that combine power, design, and innovation. He spends countless hours researching, restoring, and showcasing his collection, seeing each vehicle as a reflection of a different era, philosophy, and piece of automotive history.
